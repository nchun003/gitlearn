#View all Student Grades

The 'instructortools-viewallgrades.sh' instructor tool will allow the instructors view all student grades.
It will show all registered student names in a table and their overall score.
For greater detail, use [calcgrade.sh](grades.md).

**NOTE:**
If you use it the first time, the script will need to clone a local repository of each student.
