###Setup

Just clone the repo and add the `scripts` folder to your `PATH` using the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mikeizbicki/gitlearn
$ export PATH=$(pwd)/gitlearn/scripts:$PATH
```
In order for your `PATH` to remain across sessions you need to update your `~/.bashrc` (or similar):
```
$ echo "export PATH=$(pwd)/gitlearn/scripts:"'$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

###Adding Instructors

After setting up gitlearn onto your local repository along with your class files,
it is recommended to add the instructor keys so that student grades can be verified for validity.
On the home directory of the class repository, run:
```
$ instructortools-addgrader.sh
```

**NOTE:**
It will take time for your system to generate a strong RSA key that will be automatically push to the github repository.
Expect somewhere around 15~ minutes (depending on your current hardware).

**NOTE:**
The key will automatically push itself onto the main repository.
Make sure you have your instructors setup on the contributor setting for the repository.

**IMPORTANT:**
Make sure you generate the key on the computer that you will grade on.

###Grade Assignments
The `gradeassignment-all.sh` script lets an instructor grade an assignment for the whole class.
Before execution, the script requires the parameter of which assignment to grade.
In order to grade an assignment you will run:
```
$ gradeassignment-all.sh assignmentfolder
```
It will pull a local copy of each student's repository and check for the assignments.
It will open up a vim editor with a table setup as follow with each students name and id:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 csaccount           | name           | grade/total | grader             | sig | notes (\\n for newline)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 xxx001              |Edward Snowden  |             |                    | sig | notes (\\n for newline)
 xxx002              |Steve Jobs      |             |                    | sig | notes (\\n for newline)
 xxx003              |Bill Gates      |             |                    | sig | notes (\\n for newline)
 xxx004              |Linus Torvalds  |             |                    | sig | notes (\\n for newline)
 xxx005              |Ada Lovelace    |             |                    | sig | notes (\\n for newline)
 ...
```
At the end, it will automaically push all grades to each respected repository.

####grading individual assignments
The `gradeassignment-individual.sh` script allows an instructor to grade an assignment for a specific student, so it required to be ran with two parameters:
```
$ gradeassignment-individual.sh githubaccount assignmentfolder
```
It will pull a local copy of the student's repository and check for the assignments.
This feature might be used more often as it would allow the grader to input long feedback for the student.
It will open up a blank page in the vim editor for grading.
After the grader is done grading, the script will automatically push the grades to the respected repository.

###View Grades
In order for instructors to view all the student grades, you would run:
```
$ instructortools-viewallgrades.sh
```
This script displays registered student names in a table and their overall score.
For greater detail on an individual student, use [calcgrade.sh](grades.md).
```
================================================================================
 cs account | name                | pnts /  run ( tot) | grade run  | grade tot 
================================================================================
xxx001      |Edward Snowden       | 400/500 (705)      |  80.00 B   | 60.00 D
xxx002      |Steve Jobs           | 100/500 (705)      |  20.00 F   | 0.00 F
xxx003      |Bill Gates           | 235/500 (705)      |  47.65 F   | 27.65 F
xxx004      |Linus Torvalds       | 515/500 (705)      |  103.00 A  | 83.00 B
...

```
**NOTE:**
If you use it the first time, the script will need to clone a local repository of each student.  
In addition, you may have to run the script twice as it may not get the correct values the first time.
